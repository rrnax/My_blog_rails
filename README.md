# MyBlog App

This app is about my vision of blogs app.

Things you may want to cover:

* Rails version: 7

* Bootstrap version: 5

This aplication contains the easiest way, in my opinion, of loging, export, and data managment on the blog.
I used here "devise" gem for loging, wicked_pdf to export pdfs.
All views are designed using bootstrap 5.
